                    For this project I identified a bottleneck in our system to be a very important component responsible
                    for the collision prevension of robots. My goal was to break this component out into its own microservice 
                    and expose a gRPC interface for it. This refactor resulted in code that was much easier to maintain, scale, 
                    and improved performance.

                    wrote a snapshot + update style streaming service where the interface with the frontend was socket.io
                    over an nginx reverse proxy server. I then wrote an interface specification for our frontend team to 
                    develop against this new set of messages. This project was a huge success and our UI looks and runs amazing!

                    This was my second PCB design. It featured a 8051 processor, RAM, ROM, LCD, and keypad. This taught many 
                    embedded firmware skills like how to initialize circuit components, power, reading datasheets, and 
                    developing a BIOS.

                    This was the first PCB I ever created. It was basically just a counter where the LEDs would count up in binary when the button is pressed.
